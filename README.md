# How_did_I_learn_Angular-
this is how.

well funny name (well depeneds on what lens your using either ways) i will be recording each day for the assignment here for that makes things easier for me to see my progress and stuff!

# DAY 1
starting with angular documentaiton!
latin but kind of seemed fun its on similar grounds with most of the nextjs thingi that i do but damn me this is just front end and at the end of he day i would have to manually do routing connect it to node possibily so yeah 
that should be most of it.
# DAY 2
well i thought if i am either ways going to use html,javascript and nodejs (obivously) so i will brush up a bit so creating a few repos and then trying to warm up my mussles before i start actually working on with angular just so my absics are fit i will cover 12 quetions which will be going about with 
- Create a responsive, single-page personal portfolio using HTML and Tailwind CSS with profile, skills, and contact sections.
- Develop an interactive blog post page that allows users to submit comments and dynamically displays them using JavaScript.
- Build an interactive shopping cart that adds/removes items and calculates the total price using JavaScript arrays and objects.
- Create a webpage that fetches data from a public API and displays it asynchronously using JavaScript Promises or async/await.
- Build a simple REST API with Node.js and Express to perform CRUD operations on a collection of tasks.
- Develop a Node.js application that securely manages database credentials using environment variables loaded from a ‘.env‘ file.

** first let me get these guys done before i actually write up the next six that i want to do ... **
