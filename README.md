# How_did_I_learn_Angular-
this is how.

well funny name (well depeneds on what lens your using either ways) i will be recording each day for the assignment here for that makes things easier for me to see my progress and stuff!

# DAY 1
starting with angular documentaiton!
latin but kind of seemed fun its on similar grounds with most of the nextjs thingi that i do but damn me this is just front end and at the end of he day i would have to manually do routing connect it to node possibily so yeah 
that should be most of it.
# DAY 2
well i thought if i am either ways going to use html,javascript and nodejs (obivously) so i will brush up a bit so creating a few repos and then trying to warm up my mussles before i start actually working on with angular just so my absics are fit i will cover 12 quetions which will be going about with 
- Create a responsive, single-page personal portfolio using HTML and Tailwind CSS with profile, skills, and contact sections.
- Develop an interactive blog post page that allows users to submit comments and dynamically displays them using JavaScript.
- Build an interactive shopping cart that adds/removes items and calculates the total price using JavaScript arrays and objects.
- Create a webpage that fetches data from a public API and displays it asynchronously using JavaScript Promises or async/await.
- Build a simple REST API with Node.js and Express to perform CRUD operations on a collection of tasks.
- Develop a Node.js application that securely manages database credentials using environment variables loaded from a ‘.env‘ file.

** first let me get these guys done before i actually write up the next six that i want to do ... **

well did not expect i would complete them all in a day well done with them now so hmm that served like a major bursh up for me now in the second cycle how about we head a bit more backend kind of thingi either ways angular is going to take the place of my new front end well hmm i will go with reachjs which i love and some more nodejs well these are the next set of questions that i will do
- Design and implement a REST API using Node.js and Express to manage a collection of books (CRUD operations).
- Develop a full-stack MERN application that performs all CRUD operations on a data collection stored in MongoDB.
- Build a REST API using Express and MongoDB for user registration and login,implementing secure authentication mechanisms.
- Create a React application that manages a list of items, allowing users to add and remove items using state.
- Build a data-driven React application that fetches data from an external API and displays it for the user.
- Develop a single-page React application with a home page and an about page using React Router for navigation.

well some look useless well they would be some buffer stuff once i am done with these i should be warmed up enough to start lifiting angular correspoding application.... well how are they related ? just flexing my fingers and trying to improve my mental capacity not directly linked but its the same arm different dumbles. let me get rid of these tasks i will get back.

well one more question remains i guess so mostly tommorow i will actually be downloading angular and testing out stuff with it well warmed up senses so been a great day..! 
# DAY 3
well awaited day three is here hmm angular angular let me just go try getting out the dependencies and stuff... The officaial document had something stating get started with you firrst angulare app so less goooo!
# DAY 4
yesterday did end up going down the drain in comparision to remaining days but not today !! let see what angular has in store for me....okay just done halfway through this docss

still going to progress well set up and till now time taken was ample 2 hours 30 minutes well after spending wopping a complete of 4 hours just done with basics in angular !! 


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbe0e4fa-413b-49a0-8aa4-c33259da1cfe)


well now i think i will switch gears and get started with the assginment that has been provided !! and rest is up to practice on how many days that i spend on it hmm it should become gradually smootehr so either ways **done with basics**



I have decided to proceed with MongoDB as the database for the assignment, given its flexibility and alignment with traditional backend development practices. The project involves building a team WhatsApp–style portal for helpers, focusing primarily on Angular for the frontend.

My initial design will use a map structure with unique identifiers for each helper, accompanied by corresponding models for clean data management. Since the project requirements do not emphasize real-time data synchronization or caching, I will keep the backend simple and straightforward without implementing complex caching or real-time features at this stage.

The plan is to start with a simple, robust structure that satisfies the core requirements and then consider optimizations if time permits. This approach balances clarity and maintainability, ensuring a strong foundation before advancing further.
